2. In the form, please specify how you intend to use the dataset. 
3. You will also need to agree to the following terms and conditions:
    * You will not redistribute this dataset without our consent.
    * You will not make commercial usage of this dataset.
    * You agree to have the name of your institution listed on this page, under the list of users that obtained access.
    * If you use our dataset, related artifacts, or analysis results, please cite the following ICSE 2022 paper: Michael Cao, Khaled Ahmed, and Julia Rubin. “Rotten Apples Spoil the Bunch: An Anatomy of Google Play Malware.” In Proceedings of the 44th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), 2022. \[[pdf](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/mjulia/publications/GooglePlayMalware_2022.pdf), [bibtex](/assets/data/googleplaymalware.bib)\]
