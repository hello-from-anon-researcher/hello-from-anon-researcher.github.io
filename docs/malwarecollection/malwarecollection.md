## Overview

We detail the malware collection, in a step-by-step manner, used to retrieve malware which bypasses Google Play malware. These steps include:

1. [Collecting blogs from security companies](##blog-collection)
2. [Identifying Google Play malware blogs](##identifying-google-play-malware-blogs)
3. [Malware collection and analysis](##malware-collection-and-analysis)

## Blog Collection

Blogs were collected based on security reports. The following sections detail the collection steps.

### Identifying Security 

The first step to collect malware is retrieving Google Play malware related blogs. To do this, we searched for blog sites top security companies based on Gartner's magic quadrant for best endpoint security platforms. The resulting companies we found blogs for are the following:

1. CarbonBlack
2. Comodo
3. Cylance
4. EndGame
5. ESET
6. Fortinet
7. FSecure
8. KasperskyLab
9. Malwarebytes
10. Mcafee
11. Microsoft
12. PaloAltoNetworks
13. PandaSecurity
14. SentinelOne
15. Sophos
16. Symantec
17. TrendMicro

### Automated Blog Crawler

We built an automated blog crawler to collect blogs from the following companies. The source code of our blog crawler is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hello-from-anon-researcher/BlogScrapeUtilities/).

## Identifying Google Play Malware Blogs

### Blog Categorization

We categorized the blogs into five categories, including:

1. Google Play Malware - Blogs that describe malware bypassing Google Play Store
2. Non-Google Play Malware - Blogs describing Android malware from alternative markets
3. Non-Android Malware - Blogs describing malware from systems other than Android (ex., iOS, PC, etc.)
4. Different Language - Blogs that are not in English
5. Technology/News/Promotions - Blogs which describe current technologies, trends, or product promotions

Two researchers categorized each blog and cross-validated the results. The table below lists our categorization results for all 3,455 blogs we analyzed:

|Category|2016|2017|2018|2019|Total|
|:-------------------------------|:------------------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|Google Play Malware|50|81|41|43|215|
|Non-Google Play Malware|85|68|63|39|255|
|Non-Android Malware|10|5|14|21|50|
|Different Language|179|185|190|183|737|
|News/Promotions|484|512|580|622|2,198|
|All|808|851|888|908|3,455|

### Blog Categorization Disagreements

The two researchers found disagreements within blogs classified as Google Play malware. We summarize the distribution of disagreements by year below:

## Malware Collection and Analysis

### Identifying and Collecting Families

We identified duplicate families based on blogs which either: (1) contain the same indicators (file hash, ) or (2) refer to another blog within our list. Below is a distribution of duplicate families found per year:

|Duplicate Families||||||
|Found Families||||||


### Analyzing Google Play malware

Next we perform manual analysis on the samples. In a few cases, we were unable to analyze some samples because: (1) we could not find the malicious behavior, (2) we could not unpack the sample, (3) the sample was too obfuscated, (4) we could not identifying entry points due to extensive reflection use. The overall distribution of analyzed samples per year is shown below:


|Category|2016|2017|2018|2019|Total|
|:-------------------------------|:------------------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|Cannot Find Malicious Behavior||||||
