### Spoiled Apples Ruin the Bunch: Anatomy of Google Play Malware

Due to the rising popularity of smart phones, malware in the Android field has been increasing exponentially. With this rise, malware has increasingly evolved to bypass the defenses of the Google Play Store. Analyzing properties of such malware is an important step towards our ability to build efficient malware detection tools. To add to this issue, only two studies, Malware Genome and the Android Malware Dataset (AMD), perform in-depth analysis of Android malware to gain insights used in detection tools. Unfortunately, the malware between the years 2010 to 2016. This raises the important question--what are the characteristics of recent Android malware? 

In this study, we perform detailed analysis on a set of recent Android malware bypassing the defenses of Google Play Store between 2016 to 2019. In particular, we collect event and check conditions, hiding techniques, payloads, as well as code properties of the malware. We further relate the properties into a detailed malware signature graph. Lastly, we analyzed existing malware detection tools, and discuss them in context with our collected dataset.
